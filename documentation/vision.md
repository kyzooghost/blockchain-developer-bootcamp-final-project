# WHY A PHARMACY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN?

**To have an immutable database of prescriptions provided by authorized healthcare providers**

Where the current healthcare system has issues:
- **Healthcare data is siloed within each healthcare organisation.** A doctor, Alice, working at the Royal Satoshi Hospital cannot easily find out what drugs their patient, Bob, was given while they were staying at the St Buterin Hospital. This is critical information that Alice needs stat (meaning immediately),  especially since Bob is a severely-ill and medically complicated patient that has just come flying through the ER doors. 

In 2021, a world where people can fly to space for fun, you would imagine that healthcare data such as what medications Bob had and at what time, would be available at the Alice's fingertips. In fact most patients come into the hospital expecting this... Unfortunately they're out of luck if, like Bob, the patient has been treated at multiple hospitals. To obtain information about what happened to Bob at St Buterin Hospital, poor Alice will have to call the medical records department at the St Buterin Hospital, fax over a "Request for medical information" form, and wait until the St Buterin Hospital faxes the information over.

If Alice is lucky she will get the information she is looking for within the hour, meanwhile she is hoping that the drugs she is ordering for Bob won't have disastrous side-effect in combination with the drugs Bob just had at the St Buterin hospital. More commonly it will take half the day for the information to be faxed over, and sometimes it will be the weekend or the early morning and the medical records department is closed.

Hospitals pay out of their own pocket to implement a Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software suite of their choice. Different hospitals implement their own EMR suite and make it difficult for healthcare providers from external hospitals to access their data. This siloed, "each hospital is their own nation" approach to data management betrays common sense.

One solution is using a consortium blockchain to store patient data in an immutable database that is trusted by a local hospitals within a specified region. This blockchain would grant write privileges only to actors with a 'healthcare provider' private key, and read privileges would be similarly restricted. In this way, the question "Do I trust Alice to access the patient data on Bob created at the St Buterin Hospital?", is delegated to the magic of cryptographic algorithms, rather than a overloaded and fallible human in the medical records department.

Additional use cases
- David seeking a script for some painkillers, visits Dr Carol the local GP. David complains that he is in a lot of pain and that Panadol and Voltaren from the supermarket aren't doing a thing. Carol while sympathetic, is also suspicious that David is acting to score himself a prescription for some oxycodone tablets. Carol would access the blockchain with her private key and check if David is a 'doctor shopper' - someone goes from doctor to doctor to accummulate prescriptions for often addictive medications.
- Carol's next patient is Elon, who has just has left hospital after a one-week stay for a nasty chest infection. Carol would like to confirm the prescriptions that Elon was discharged from hospital with. Carol again accesses the blockchain for this information.
- Elon lost his paper script for antibiotics that he was prescribed when he was discharged from the hospital. No worries, he can log into the pharmacy smart contract frontend with his private key and view his pending prescriptions online. With a click of a few buttons, he can purchase the script and have it delivered to his home. Dr Carol, as well as the doctors who have treated Elon as the hospital, can check whether or not naughty Elon has claimed his prescription.
