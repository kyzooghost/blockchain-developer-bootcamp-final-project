Thoughts
- Need to create or access index of ETH mainnet transactions for a time period (Will this require a crapload of API calls? This is the pivotal part of this project)
- Need to filter above index for smart contract created in the last week
- Need to create table for "smart contracts created in the last week" and add colums for "Transactions", "Date created", "Gas used", "Unique users"

Data sorting thoughts
- I want to have the option to blacklist or remove certain smart contracts from my dashbaord
- How does Etherscan mark whether an address is a smart contract?
- Is there anyway to trace what from what frontend are contract calls coming from?
- If I enable Metamask to connect to it, what would the point of this feature be? Why would someone need to connect to their MM account to use my app?

Create a UI
- Probably going to cost too much API calls to make the page auto-refresh every 1-5 seconds, so make it a manual refresh button
- Have options to view by "Most transactions", "most gas used", "most unique active addresses"

Beyond-MVP thoughts
- Make the dashboard work for Polygon, Avalanche, BSC Chain, Fantom, Solana

APIs?
- Alchemy
- Covalent
- Etherscan
- Cryptosheets
- The Graph

Random relevant notes on studying the course
- A contract contains EVM code and storage, and has a corresponding code hash and storage hash; an EOA doesn't
- Any transaction without a 'to' field is assumed to be a contract creation?

UPDATE 10 SEP 2021
- Can I integrate a smart contract into this? Nansen Hot contracts doesn't have a contract
