## DEPLOYING ON GANACHE TEST BLOCKCHAIN

To deploy your own instance of the Pharmacy smart contract on a Ganache test blockchain, you will first need to install Ganache - https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache

You will then need to link this project to Ganache by using Ganache's 'ADD PROJECT' feature and selecting this project's truffle-config.js file.

Then make sure the Ganache server settings are at default
- Hostname: 127.0.0.1
- Port Number: 7545

Then type

    npm run test-ganache

This will deploy the Pharmacy smart contract onto your Ganache instance, as well as a frontend connected to the smart contract at http://localhost:3000/
